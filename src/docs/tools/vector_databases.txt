# Vector databases
As the name gives away, vector databases provide a database infrastructure, specifically made for storing vectors.
The key functionality is storing vectors and retrieving them based on a reference vector by similarity (distance).
As such, they are crucial for introducing large amounts of knowledge (content rather than behaviour) to e.g. a Large Language Model via Semantic Search.

A vector database of word embeddings can cluster semantically close words together, e.g. "Queen" and "King", which might only differ in a single dimension (gender).
On the other hand, the word "Auto" should not be very close to either of them but very close to "wheel"/"tire" and "engine". Now, we can be pretty sure, that "Carriage" should lie somewhere between "Queen"/"King" and "Auto".
However, semantical vector representations of words have very high dimensions, so in practice, the distance between words is very complex.
