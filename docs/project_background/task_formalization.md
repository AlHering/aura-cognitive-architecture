# Background
Task formalization is the central challenge when it comes to translating the wanted behaviour into a "more" computer-understandable format.
Furthermore, in multi-agent systems, this formalization is the core to building up a common communication ground for different agents while preserving generalization capabilities.
In the same way, the formalization will limit the options for interfacing foreign systems and the user.

# Goal
Implement and evaluate different approaches for task formalization. Also take overall architectural concepts into account when evaluating the formalization approach as information carrier for communication and responsibility distribution between different agents.
