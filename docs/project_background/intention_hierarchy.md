# Background
Single-agent architectures can be trained or finetuned on very specific tasks and intergrated easily with different systems.
Validating, debugging, iterating, extending and comparing single-agent solution with each other is also easier.
However, besides challenges in coordination, efficiency and resource distribution, multi-agent systems also introduce optimization opportunities for scalability, robustness and adaptability/flexibility
